Project 03
To finish Prjoect 03 I just built off of exercise-3d.
As you can see I made it a halloween theme due to it being October. Now I will go through the changes I made.
-Orange Checkered print
-purple sphere(with checker print)
-starting music
-If hovering over start it highlights green
-Borders are orange
-score, life, and block count are orange
-instead of the eyeball tracking the ball i created a pumpkin
-the ball is actually a little ghost but it is hard to tell
-changed the end screen colors
Overall, I tried to make it flow the best I could with the knowledge of unity I have but I think it gives off a halloween vibe! I showed it to my mom and she thought it was pretty cool. Also, my power has been going in and out and its been pretty tricky to add stuff before it shuts off and doesn't save. I had a good time with this unit overall!
